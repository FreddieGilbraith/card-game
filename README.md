---

`ingrates` borrows heavily from [nact](nact), but uses plain strings as addresses. This makes it easier to break your actor system up across workers/threads/processes/devices and transmit messages between them.

`ingrates` is very much WIP, and has no real world usage. I also don't know much about formal actor systems, so this might be missing some key functionality that you really want; please get in touch if so.
